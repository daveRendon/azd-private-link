### 1. What Resources are getting deployed

This scenario is aligned with the Az-104 and Az-700 path and provides a demo solution for managing overlapping IP address spaces with Azure Private Link.

Overlapping IP address spaces often happens when networks from different customers or companies are connected, especially when thereâ€™s no centralized IP address management. 

This scenario guides how to make applications running in one Azure virtual network accessible to users in another virtual network with an overlapping IP address space.

Resources deployed: 

 - VMConsumerOsDisk: Virtual Machine Disk
 - myVM0OsDisk: Virtual Machine Disk
 - myVM1OsDisk: Virtual Machine Disk
 - myILB: Internal Load Balancer
 - VMConsumer-nic: Virtual Machine network interface
 - myPLS.nic.d2543340-e40e-434f-bb7c-ab8997cd7180: Network Interface
 - myPrivateEndpoint.nic.1a0ace1e-74eb-4055-926c-bca971fae1b8: Network Interface
 - myVM-nic0: Network Interface
 - myVM-nic1: Network Interface
 - myPrivateEndpoint: Private endpoint
 - myPLS: Private link service
 - VMConsumerPublicIP: Public IP address
 - VMConsumer: Virtual machine
 - myVM0: Virtual Machine 
 - myVM1: Virtual Machine 
 - NetworkA-PrivateEndpoint: Virtual network
 - NetworkB-PrivateLink: Virtual network

### 2. What can I demo from this scenario after deployment

<br></br>

Once you deploy the environment, you should be able to RDP to the VMConsumer virtual machine.

Then, open a browser in your VMConsumer machine and, using a browser, access the private IP address of the Private Endpoint, like 10.0.0.5. You should be able to access VM0 and VM1.
